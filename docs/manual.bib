abstract = {The Maier-Saupe model of the nematic phase with an orientational order parameter is extended to the smectic A phase by introducing a new order parameter, the amplitude of a density wave in the direction of the nematic preferred axis. Self-consistent equations for the two order parameters are derived from an anisotropic model interaction and are solved numerically. We calculate the order parameters, the entropy, and the specific heat as a function of temperature for several values of dimensionless interaction strength $\alpha$ for the smectic A phase. The transition temperatures plotted versus $\alpha$ provide a theoretical phase diagram which resembles experimental plots of transition temperature versus alkyl chain length for homologous series of compounds. The model qualitatively reproduces chemical trends in transition entropies. Experiments are suggested to measure the order parameters in the smectic A phase.},

@article{Honeycutt1987,
abstract = {The properties of small clusters of Lennard-Jones atoms were studied by using molecular dynamics simulations. Clusters containing from 13 to 147 atoms were found to undergo a transition, analogous to a melting transition for bulk materials, from a low-energy solidlike structure at low temperatures to a set of higher energy liquidlike structures at high temperatures. The transition creates noticeable features in plots of the equilibrium energy of clusters as a function of temperature, but the shapes of the curves depend on the size of the cluster and on whether a canonical ensemble or microcanonical ensemble is used for calculating the properties. The nonequilibrium energy as a function of temperature on heating or cooling at a finite rate can differ significantly from the equilibrium results. Coexistence among the minimum-energy structure, high-energy liquidlike structures, and typically one or more intermediate structures was observed over a range of temperatures. Results from potential energy minimization of fcc and icosahedral structures of various sizes indicate that a Lennard-Jones cluster must contain at least 5000 atoms before the fcc structure becomes more stable than the structure of the Mackay icosahedra.},

abstract = {Structural transformation is prone to alteration under crystalline deformation for multiple structural symmetry groups. Such transformation usually includes a large-scale number representing atomic bonding and material deformation mechanisms in the vicinity of voids, dislocation cores and other defects for diverse crystal systems. Selected analytical methods should be able to distinguish prefect crystal structures of multiple crystalline systems while extracting distinct crystalline symmetry groups from nearby stacking faults, crack surfaces or other features. Some work has been done to optimize such identification in the form of Common Neighborhood Parameter CNP formulation. In this paper, an improved approach towards structural identification revolving around predominance of common nearest neighbors of atoms is introduced with two separate parameterizations for arbitrary crystal structures. The approach is called Predominant Common Neighborhood Parameter PCNP. The method is proposed to characterize cross-species interactions with more complex centrosymmetric space groups or crystals with no common first nearest neighbors for certain atomic species. We validate the method against conventional Centrosymmetry Parameter CSP and Common Neighbor Analysis CNA for multiple simulation conditions, where the introduced method illustrates higher sensitivity than CNP analysis for multiple geometries and defect characterization regardless of the atom's species. Further enhancement of the method has been introduced to include a complex, non-monoatomic centrosymmetric crystal with a P6/mmm space group, typically found in certain ceramic materials such as Zirconium Diboride.},

@article{Bartok2013,
abstract = {We review some recently published methods to represent atomic neighbourhood environments, and analyse their relative merits in terms of their faithfulness and suitability for fitting potential energy surfaces. The crucial properties that such representations (sometimes called descriptors) must have are differentiability with respect to moving the atoms, and invariance to the basic symmetries of physics: rotation, reflection, translation, and permutation of atoms of the same species. We demonstrate that certain widely used descriptors that initially look quite different are specific cases of a general approach, in which a finite set of basis functions with increasing angular wave numbers are used to expand the atomic neighbourhood density function. Using the example system of small clusters, we quantitatively show that this expansion needs to be carried to higher and higher wave numbers as the number of neighbours increases in order to obtain a faithful representation, and that variants of the descriptors converge at very different rates. We also propose an altogether new approach, called Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), that sidesteps these difficulties by directly defining the similarity between any two neighbourhood environments, and show that it is still closely connected to the invariant descriptors. We test the performance of the various representations by fitting models to the potential energy surface of small silicon clusters and the bulk crystal.},

@article{Duboue-Dijon2015,
abstract = {A wide range of geometric order parameters have been suggested to characterize the local structure of liquid water and its tetrahedral arrangement, but their respective merits have remained elusive. Here, we consider a series of popular order parameters and analyze molecular dynamics simulations of water respectively in the bulk and in the hydration shell of a hydrophobic solute, at 298 K and 260 K. We show that these parameters are weakly correlated and probe different distortions, e.g. the angular vs. radial disorders. We first combine these complementary descriptions to analyze the structural rearrangements leading to the density maximum in liquid water. Our results reveal no sign of a heterogeneous mixture and show that the density maximum arises from the depletion in interstitial water molecules upon cooling. In the hydration shell of the hydrophobic moiety of propanol, the order parameters suggest that the water local structure is similar to that in the bulk, with only a very weak depletion in ordered configurations, thus confirming the absence of any iceberg-type structure. Finally, we show that the main structural fluctuations that affect water reorientation dynamics in the bulk are angular distortions, which we explain by the jump hydrogen-bond exchange mechanism.},

The order is predominantly icosahedral, although there is also a cubic component which we attribute to the periodic boundary conditions. Results are obtained for liquids cooled in an icosahedral pair potential as well. Only a modest amount of orientational order appears in a relaxed Finney dense-random-packing model. In contrast, we find essentially perfect icosahedral bond correlations in alternative "amorphon" cluster models of glass structure.},

abstract = {Local structure characterization with the bond-orientational order parameters q4, q6, ... introduced by Steinhardt et al. has become a standard tool in condensed matter physics, with applications including glass, jamming, melting or crystallization transitions and cluster formation. Here we discuss two fundamental flaws in the definition of these parameters that significantly affect their interpretation for studies of disordered systems, and offer a remedy. First, the definition of the bond-orientational order parameters considers the geometrical arrangement of a set of neighboring spheres NN(p) around a given central particle p; we show that procedure to select the spheres constituting the neighborhood NN(p) can have greater influence on both the numerical values and qualitative trend of ql than a change of the physical parameters, such as packing fraction. Second, the discrete nature of neighborhood implies that NN(p) is not a continuous function of the particle coordinates; this discontinuity, inherited by ql, leads to a lack of robustness of the ql as structure metrics. Both issues can be avoided by a morphometric approach leading to the robust Minkowski structure metrics ql'. These ql' are of a similar mathematical form as the conventional bond-orientational order parameters and are mathematically equivalent to the recently introduced Minkowski tensors [Europhys. Lett. 90, 34001 (2010); Phys. Rev. E. 85, 030301 (2012)].},

Here, we show through a machine learning analysis of nucleation simulations on a database of diverse model substrates that a set of physical descriptors for heterogeneous ice nucleation can be identified. Our results reveal that, beyond Vonnegut's connection with the lattice match to ice, three new microscopic factors help to predict the ice nucleating ability. These are: local ordering induced in liquid water, density reduction of liquid water near the surface and corrugation of the adsorption energy landscape felt by water. With this we take a step towards quantitative understanding of heterogeneous ice nucleation and the in silico design of materials to control ice formation.},

The melting temperature of water in the pore was Tporem = 223 K, 51 K lower than the melting point of bulk water in the model and in excellent agreement with experimental determinations for 3 nm silica pores. Liquid and ice coexist in equilibrium at the melting point and down to temperatures as low as 180 K. Liquid water is located at the interface of the pore wall, increasing from one monolayer at the freezing temperature, Tporef = 195 K, to two monolayers a few degrees below Tporem. Crystallization of ice in the pore occurs through homogeneous nucleation. At the freezing temperature, the critical nucleus contains ∼75 to 100 molecules, with a radius of gyration similar to the radius of the pore. The critical nuclei contain features of both cubic and hexagonal ice, although stacking of hexagonal and cubic layers is not defined until the nuclei reach ∼150 molecules. The structure of the confined ice is rich in stacking faults, in agreement with the interpretation of X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments. Though the presence of cubic layers is twice as prevalent as hexagonal ones, the crystals should not be considered defective Ic as sequences with more than three adjacent cubic (or hexagonal) layers are extremely rare in the confined ice. {\textcopyright} 2010 the Owner Societies.},
